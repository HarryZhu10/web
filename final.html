    <p>
     The purpose of our project was to create a Python function that made it easier to sort CSV files and turn them into HTML. 
      The function will have two inputs. The first will be the CSV document and the second one will be the tags of each file. The output will be a string that contains
      the HTML code. The contents of the HTML code will be the tags, links, and previews. You will be able to run the HTML code and it will create a website. The 
      website will consists of all the tags, links of each CSV file, and the preview of it. The code makes it so much easier for someone to look for a specific 
      file within a folder. The previews to the links will allow the person to see if they are going to the correct website.
