    <h3> Project Description: </h3>

    <p>
      The purpose of our project was to create a Python program that makes it easier to sort a bunch of files using a CSV document.
      The function will read the CSV file and a search query, and the output will be a string that contains
      the HTML code. The contents of the HTML code will be the links and previews to the search results. You will be able to run the HTML code and it will create and HTML file on your computer.
      The website will consists of all the tags, links of each CSV file, and the preview of it. The code makes it much easier for someone to look for a specific
      file within a folder. The preview to the links will allow the person to see if they are opening the correct file.    
    </p>

    <h3> How to Use: </h3>

    <p>
      Run the program in the same folder containing template.html, directorystyling.css, and the CSV document. Make sure the CSV document is named "tags.csv". The program will prompt two things in the shell, the name or path of the folder containing the files and the search query.
      Once they have been entered, the program will generate an html document named dir.html, which displays the results of the search.
    </p>
    <p> This can be used with any set of files, given that there is a corresponding csv file. The folder in question also does not have to be in the same directory as the python file, but this is not recommended as there can be problems with formatting. The csv can also be in any format, as long as the first column contains the names of the files</p>

    <h3> How it Works: </h3>

    <p>
      The python code consists of a bunch of different functions that works together and return a string that contains the HTML code for the CSV files provided.
      The python code will first import the CSV files that you want to sort.
      The "makedict" function will take the CSV files and break them into dictionaries with filenames as keys and a list of information regarding the files as values. 
      Then, the "search" function compares each dictionary value to query and adds it to a list if it matches.
      The "makeheader", "makelinks", and "makefooter" functions each prepare part of the HTML document by taking parts of the template and modifying them, replacing placeholders with variables.
      The "makelinks" function takes the list of results and generaterates a preview using the "preview" function, which attempts to open the files and uses the "shorten" function to make sure the text fits in the box.
      All of this is then combined by the "makehtml" function, and the program writes the result to "dir.html".

    <h3> Known Bugs and Errors: </h3>

      <ul>
        <li> If a filename exceeds the banner's length, it will clip outside of the box </li>
        <li> Blank newlines do not register correctly, causing the preview to not take up the entire box </li>
        <li> The box doesn't change color when hovering over the filename portion </li>
        <li> It will not work properly if the first column of the CSV file does not contain the names of the files </li>
	<li> The folder path must be exact, otherwise the program will not be able to generate the files and links will be invalid</li>
	<li> The previews only work for plaintext documents, other files such as images will not display properly</li>
      </ul>
