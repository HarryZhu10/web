    <p> Proper nutrition is also one of the most important things that you need to manage. If you have poor nutrition, it may gravely harm your stamina. Usually in a basketball game, 
      you are constantly sprinting back and forth the entire court. Each possesion is very short. If you don't have the stamina to keep up, then you will either perform extremely poor
      or be taken out of the game. Poor nutrition also harms your muscle growth and explosiveness. Lacking in all these will make you ineffective on offense and on defense.
