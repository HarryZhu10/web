<h2> Be Creative
 

<p>
Although this isn't a physical skill, it is one of the most important one needed to improve your performance. Being creative allows you to be versatile and unpredictable
    in a basketball game. In order for you to get past your defender, you must make sure that they aren't able to read your next move.

	If you are creative, then the opponent has to try to predict one out of many actions that you may take in the next second. Creativity is also important in improving your game off the court. For example, you may
      think of a way to defend an opponent a certain way the next time or create your own training regime that targets what aspects you need to improve on. You can find ways to be
      creative in the link at the end of this section. It gives you a sample.
