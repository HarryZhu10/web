  <p> Basketball is a very physical sport and having a physical advantage is very beneficial. For example, if you are strong enough, you can finish with contact(more potential points). 
    Constant training also puts you in a mindset of a winner. It means that you care enough to try to succeed. If you stop working out or playing basketball for a day, you may feel very stiff the next day.
  Sometimes you may even stop wanting to train and you may waste several months worth of progress. If you think about it, basketball is just doing the same thing over and over again. 
    If you are able to build up a solid muscle memory, then the game would be easier for you. Here's a link that will give you various exercises and reasons why you should do them.
