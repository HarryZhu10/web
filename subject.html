  <li>Be Creative-</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Although this isn't a physical skill, it is one of the most important one needed to improve your performance. Being creative allows you to be versatile and unpredictable
    in a basketball game. In order for you to get past your defender, you must make sure that they aren't able to read your next move. If you are creative, then the opponent
      has to try to predict one out of many actions that you may take in the next second. Creativity is also important in improving your game off the court. For example, you may
      think of a way to defend an opponent a certain way the next time or create your own training regime that targets what aspects you need to improve on. You can find ways to be
      creative in the link at the end of this section. It gives you a sample.

  <li>Constant Training-</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Basketball is a very physical sport and having a physical advantage is very beneficial. For example, if you are strong enough, you can finish with contact(more potential points). 
    Constant training also puts you in a mindset of a winner. It means that you care enough to try to succeed. If you stop working out or playing basketball for a day, you may feel very stiff the next day.
  Sometimes you may even stop wanting to train and you may waste several months worth of progress. If you think about it, basketball is just doing the same thing over and over again. 
    If you are able to build up a solid muscle memory, then the game would be easier for you. Here's a link that will give you various exercises and reasons why you should do them.

      <li>Proper Nutrition-</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Proper nutrition is also one of the most important things that you need to manage. If you have poor nutrition, it may gravely harm your stamina. Usually in a basketball game, 
      you are constantly sprinting back and forth the entire court. Each possesion is very short. If you don't have the stamina to keep up, then you will either perform extremely poor
      or be taken out of the game. Poor nutrition also harms your muscle growth and explosiveness. Lacking in all these will make you ineffective on offense and on defense.
